$f90compiler = Name of your FORTRAN 90 compiler (preferred compilers: ifort) 
Also works for executables compiled by gfortran, f95 etc. (ALTHOUGH NOT RECCOMENDED) 

INSTALLATION:

chmod +x install

./install $f90compiler

The main shell script (CompPlot) is now ready to be used

RUN:

cp TESTPDBS/2haq.pdb .  (EXAMPLE INPUT)

./CompPlot -inp  [PDB_filename]
./CompPlot -inp  [PDB_filename] target [residue_number-residue_identity]
./CompPlot -inp  2haq.pdb
./CompPlot -inp  2haq.pdb -tar 151-PHE
./CompPlot -help (for help)

REFRESH: 

./refresh (Does not remove the executables stored in EXEC and the Library files in the current directory)

CLEAN: 

./clean (Cleans everything and returns to the RAW downloaded state of the package) 

if cleaned, 
./install  HAS TO BE EXECUTED AGAIN prior to RUN

FOR AN INCOMPLETE OR ABNORMAL (INTERRUPTED) TERMINATION OF  ./CompPlot  
ENSURE TO RUN  ./clean.csh  THEN  ./install.csh PRIOR TO THE NEXT RUN OF THE PROGRAM
ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN ALSO run ./refresh.csh in which case you do not need to reinstall the program
ENSURE to remove files starting with specific filenames in that case (e.g., rm -f 1psr.*)

The filename can have any number of characters but must not contain any '.' (or space ' ') 
And must have the  extension .pdb; 
e.g., 2haq.pdb, deca.pdb, 1234.pdb, x1c3.pdb 1abc-wc.pdb 2haq-00001.pdb 2haq-energy-minimized_CHARMM.pdb etc.

PDB file must not contain more than 990 amino acid residues (EXAMPLES OF LARGE (> 800 residues) ARE PDBS PROVIDED IN TESTPDBS/LARGE/
And should consist of only a single polypeptide chain
Atoms must not have multiple occupancies
residue sequence number must not exceed 3 digits (999)
residue sequence number must not contain any non-integer characters (e.g., 42A, 78B etc)

Only isolated metal ions listed (in appropriate format) in the table below will be considered
and other hetero atoms will be ignored

water coordinates are trimmed if present in the input pdb file
since water and surface bound ligands are modeled as bulk solvent

In case of missing atoms / patches of residues in the input pdb, the (Sm,Em) values may not be authentic

PDB file should definitely be Hydrogen-fitted by Reduce (v.2) (available at: http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/downloads/software/reduce/)
FOR MORE INSTRUCTIONS, SEE THE FILE : REDUCEv.2-DOWNLOAD.LINK in SARAMA/

The program will automatically reject input pdb files in any of the following cases:

1. Incorrect Filename (as specified above)
2. Files including non-naturally occuring amino-acids (with record id 'ATOM')
3. Files containing more than one polypeptide chains (oligomeric proteins)
4. Files with no Hydrogen atoms
5. Files with Hydrogen atom types inconsistant with REDUCE, v.2 format ('H' in the 12-12 column range, e.g., HD11, HE21)
6. Files containing more than 990 residues
7. Files contaning residue-sequence-numbers exceeding 3 digits (999)
8. Files containing redundant residue identities for the same residue position 
9. If only main-chain (backbone) atoms are provided


Atom and residue types will have to be consistent with brookhaven (PDB) format
