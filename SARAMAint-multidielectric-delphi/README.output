           INSTRUCTIONS TO ACCESS DIFFERENT OUTPUTS GENERATED BY SARAMAInt
======================================================================================

======================================================================================
======================================================================================
======================================================================================
FOR A GIVEN PDB ($pdb.pdb), THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY IS OUT$pdb
======================================================================================
======================================================================================
======================================================================================
GO TO THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY BY cd OUT$pdb/
THEN,
USE GHOSTVIEW (gv) to VIEW THE PLOTS (IN POSTSCRIPT (.ps) FORMAT) 

gv $pdb-cb.ps
gv $pdb-pb.ps
gv $pdb-pe.ps 

USE RASMOL TO VIEW THE INTERIOR VDW SURFACE (WHITE) IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE WHOLE PROTEIN VDW SURFACE (BLUE)
THIS SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED ONLY FROM THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY WHERE THE SURFACE FILE ($pdb-surf.pdb) IS LOCATED

rasmol -script $pdb-intsurf.spt 

THE ACTUAL ACCESSABLE SURFACE AREA (IN ANGSTROM^2) BURIED UPON COMPLEXATION (AVARAGED OVER TWO CHAINS) IS ALSO GIVEN IN THE OUTFILE: $pdb.asaAngsq

FOR METAL COORDINATING INTERFACES ALSO FIND THE FOLLOWING RASMOL SCRIPT FILE TO LOCATE THEM ALONG WITH THE COORDINATED RESIDUES IN THE STRUCTURE

rasmol -script $pdb-met.spt

AND THE COORDINATION INTERACTIONS LISTED IN THE FOLLOWING FILE

cat $pdb.mco

DISPLAY RESIDUE BY RESIDUE LISTING

cat $pdb-comp.cb
cat $pdb-comp.pb
cat $pdb-comp.pe

GET THE COMPLEMENTARITY (CS_l) AND ACCESSIBILITY SCORES (rGb) BY 

cat $pdb.CS

FOR DESCRIPTION OF SCORES READ TO THE FOLLOWING PAPER:

Applications of the complementarity plot in error detection and structure validation of proteins
Sankar Basu, Dhananjay Bhattacharyya, and Rahul Banerjee*
Indian Journal of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 2014, 51 (June) : 188-200
=================================================================================================

FOR A PROTEIN WITH NO (COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY BURIED) RESIDUES, ONLY ACCESSIBILITY SCORE (rGb) IS GIVEN
